# Inspired Panic - Theme
This is CSS to over ride the default styles for the code syntax highlighter in Squarespace themes. It currently only overwrites the light styles with dark ones if your using the dark styles in Squarespace already you'll need to modify the selectors and add .dark in front of the selectors in the file.

It's inspired by the Panic Palette theme created for Coda App by [Cabel Sasser](http://cabel.me/) a darker theme with official [Panic](https://panic.com/) colours (Read: sort of here!)
